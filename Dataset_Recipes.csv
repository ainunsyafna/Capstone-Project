Using a fork, beat together the eggs and milk mixture and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well. As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy. The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated. Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any leftover crusty bits. Discard these bits. Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. To shape the Bigoli: Knead dough until smooth and tight, and let rest 20 minutes. Note: Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe. They are essential for a light pasta. Cut the dough into 6 pieces, and run each piece through a meat grinder set to the smallest extrusion size. As the pasta exits, cut it into 12-inch pieces and immediately dust with flour. Lay out onto a cookie sheet dusted with cornmeal, being careful to keep the strands separate. Finish all 6 pieces the same way."

Add the mustard, mustard seed, any other spice you may want for variation, and sesame to the butter. Incorporate as much liquid as you can by whisking it in. Chill for an hour before continuing if that is a problem for you. To your finely minced fresh herbs/vegetables/fruit, add the mirin, vinegar, or citrus juice, other flavorings, and salt. Toss and let sit for 10 minutes. Drain excess liquid. Can you eliminate this step? Yes, but this dressing enhances the add-ins, if you have the time. Add the optional chopped/finely minced anchovy. Mix in your ""dressed"" or ""undressed"" concoction to the butter. An another alternative is to process these together in a blender, if you want more of a final pureed vs. rustic style.

When its mayonnaise stop and add the tuna and the anchovies and just a small splash of vinegar. Pulse it until smooth and creamy. Strain the sauce through a coarse sieve such as a tamis. Set aside in a large bowl. For the meat balls; tear up the bread and sprinkle with cold water and white vinegar just to soften it up. Chop the sage rather finely. There are tools for that; either a very sharp knife or even better a mezzaluna. Mince the shallots In a large bowl, one in which you can fit both of your hands, combine the meat, the eggs, shallots and the sage. Squeeze as much liquid as you can from the bread and work that into the meat mixture with your scrubbed hands. Sea salt here would be good. Ground pepper too. Get a pot of water boiling, add salt and reduce to a simmer. Meanwhile (the dreaded meanwhile), form veal mixture into small, very small meatballs. Like the size of a ping pong ball. Add just a splash of vinegar to the simmering water. Working just one or two at a time at the beginning add your meatballs to the poaching liquid. Keep the heat at a steady simmer. After about 15 minutes spoon one out and check for doneness. They must be cooked all of the way through. When they are done scoop out onto a sheet pan to rest for a minute or so. Now the capers.

When you get ready to plate things up, carefully drain off the water using your hands or a strainer. The capers are there to finish the plate.

Let it sit, stirring occasionally, while you prepare the sauce for the fish. MAKE THE CILANTRO TAMARIND PASTE: Put the cilantro, garlic, tamarind, 2 tablespoons plus one teaspoon of soy sauce, the onion, shallots, anchovies or anchovy paste, and the juice of half of one lime into your food processor. Pull the tamarind apart into small pieces before putting into the food processor, to make sure there are no hard seeds in it. If you want heat, add a fresh chili that has been coarsely chopped. Process for about ten seconds, scrape down, process again, scrape down and, if necessary, process a third time. You want the pieces to be small and the mixture well combined, but you do not want a liquidy puree. Heat the vegetable oil in a small, heavy saucepan with a lid. Before it starts to smoke, add the onion, cilantro and tamarind mixture and stir well. Simmer for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally. Put the lid on and set aside. It will hold, unrefrigerated, for a few hours. PREPARE THE FISH: Fire up your grill to medium heat or preheat your oven on the broiler setting. If broiling, put some foil down on the pan. Pat dry the swordfish steaks and sprinkle well with salt. Rub in the olive oil. Juice another half lime and set aside. FINISH MAKING THE GLAZE: Press the tamarind pulp through a fine strainer. Add the juice of half a lime and a teaspoon of soy sauce. Juice the other half lime and set aside. TOAST THE PUMPKIN SEEDS, IF USING: Preheat the oven to about 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Toast the pumpkin seeds on a baking sheet lined with parchment, on the top shelf of your oven, turning once, for about five minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove from the oven and toss in a bowl with 1 teaspoon of soy sauce or more to taste. Put back in the oven on the parchment-lined pan for 2 - 3 minutes. Remove and set aside. COOK THE FISH: When the grill or broiler is hot - you want your coals to be white -- cook the fish on one side for 3 -5 minutes minutes, depending on the thickness of the steaks and on how well you like your swordfish cooked. While the fish is grilling, bring the sauce to a good simmer over medium heat. Add the rice wine and cook for a minute or two. (When I broil, I don't pierce the foil, so that I can collect the juices, which I then strain and add to the sauce at this point.) Taste the sauce and add more lime juice -- or a pinch of sugar if it's too tart -- and salt, to taste. Flip the fish over and baste with the tamarind glaze. Cook the second side, then flip once more and baste again, cooking only for about ten or fifteen seconds. Serve with the sauce. Garnish with the tamari roasted pumpkin seeds, if using. Enjoy!! ;o)"

I do not like them; it now feels like we live in an antiseptic hotel, or worse, a funeral parlor. And yet, they are necessary. They are thermal lined for insulation. The Northeast's got a chill on, that despite a few days' worth of traditional January thaw, is back. I like the cold. A lot. But we woke to 12 degrees Fahrenheit the other morning, and the wind careening round the corners of our top-floor flat feels like it's scraping the bricks off the building. This cold has teeth.What we need here is something we have to wait months for, the polar, if you will, opposite of dead car batteries, black ice, and daggered icicles poised over doorways. What we need is summer, preferably the kind enjoyed in the Italian Mediterranean, where terra cotta walls radiate heat, geraniums radiate red, and fragrant pots of tomato sauce radiate from kitchen windows.Though terra cotta walls and geraniums, and even a kitchen window, are hard to come by at the moment, fragrant pots of tomato sauce are just about as easy as making cups of hot cocoa from scratch.The secret lies in flinging open the doors of your cupboards and fridge, and pulling out what happens to be on hand, what Simona of Briciole, mistress of Italian culinary and cultural linguistics, calls ""aglio, olio e peperoncino,"" (garlic, oil, and red chili pepper), which are likely ingredients bound to be available no matter what. To many of us, a similarly simple sauce is more familiarly known as sugo alla puttanesca, named rather disparagingly after prostitutes or something of little value, from the word puttanata. But I beg to differ with the popular urban legend of it. Though this sauce is easy and fast, it can hardly be confused with cheap.Puttanesca Sauce - My own recipe, based on whatever I had on hand. I did not use anchovies, although they are traditional. (Though I used yellow heirloom tomatoes, any fresh, high-quality variety of tomato is a wonderful thing in such an elegantly minimalist recipe.)Ingredients8 large tomatoes3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil2 cloves garlic, minced or pressed1/4 cup pimento-stuffed green olives, sliced1/4 cup brine-cured black olives, sliced3 tablespoons capers, drained but not rinsed3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes1/4 teaspoon ground black pepperNo additional salt needed, especially if you add anchovies (2 tinned fillets, mashed in a mortar and pestle).MethodCore tomatoes. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add tomatoes to water, and reduce temperature to simmer. Watch for tomato skins to split and curl away, about 5 minutes. Remove tomatoes carefully from hot water onto cutting board. Allow to cool slightly, then peel tomatoes using a fork. Discard skins.In a large saucepan, warm olive oil over low heat.

Bake for 10-15 minutes, then remove from the oven and remove the paper and beans (be careful they will be HOT!).In the meantime, heat the oil in a large frying pan and add the onions and garlic. The trick is to cook them long & slow so that they soften and sweeten but do not brown. Be patient and stir lots it takes about 30 minutes! After the first 15 minutes, add the tomato so that the flavours can meld. Add the thyme at the end of the cooking process and season with pepper and salt if desired (but rememebr that the olives and anchovies will add a lot of salt to the final dish).When the onion mix is very soft, remove from heat and spread into your pre-baked pie crust. Cut each anchovy fillet in half lengthways and use the strips to create a lattice pattern on top of the onions. Decorate each diamond of the lattice pattern with a black olive.

In an 8-quart Dutch oven, heat 2 Tbs. of the oil over medium heat. Season the ribs with 2 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. pepper. Add half of the ribs to the pot (or as many as will fit without overlap), and cook, turning with tongs, until nicely browned on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side.

Make Ahead Tips It's best to braise short ribs a day (or at least several hours) ahead for a couple of reasons. First, this allows you to chill the sauce so it can be defatted thoroughly. Also, the flavors only get better with time. To reheat, arrange the meat snugly in a baking dish, cover with foil, and put in a 350F oven. Reheat the sauce on the stovetop. nutrition information (per serving): Calories (kcal): 450, Fat (kcal): 25, Fat Calories (g): 220, Saturated Fat (g): 8, Protein (g): 35, Monounsaturated Fat (g): 11, Carbohydrates (mg): 10, Polyunsaturated Fat (mg): 3.5, Sodium (g): 630, Cholesterol (g): 85, Fiber (g): 2, Photo: Scott Phillips Rate this Recipe and View Reviews"

Taste the vinaigrette; it should be slightly acidic,so add more lemon juice if necessary. Let stand for at least 1 hour so the fennel softens and the flavors mingle. Make the brochettes: Heat a gas grill to medium high or prepare a medium hot charcoal fire. Cut the salmon crosswise into 1-inch-wide strips, 3to 4 oz. each. Thread the skewers through the salmon strips: starting at the tapered end, carefully pierce the flesh, pushing the skewer all the way through to the fat end until the point pokes through. When the grill is just on the hot side of medium (you should be able to hold your hand just above the grate for 2seconds), use tongs to clean the grate with a lightly oiled paper towel. Season the salmon lightly with salt and brush lightly with olive oil. Put the brochettes on the grill, skin side down, keeping the exposed skewer ends away from the fire if using bamboo. The salmon will cook quickly but not always at the same rate. Cook until the skin is crisp and it releases from the grill, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the brochettes with tongs or a spatula and cook another 1 minute. If necessary, turn again and cook another 1 minute. The salmon is done when the flesh feels firm and almost begins to flake apart. Put the brochettes on a platter and drizzle immediately with the vinaigrette. nutrition information (per serving): Calories (kcal): 590, Fat (kcal): 44, Fat Calories (g): 390, Saturated Fat (g): 6, Protein (g): 46, Monounsaturated Fat (g): 26, Carbohydrates (mg): 2, Polyunsaturated Fat (mg): 9, Sodium (g): 780, Cholesterol (g): 125, Fiber (g): 1, Photo: Sarah Jay Rate this Recipe and View Reviews"

In a small saucepan, combine the sherry and the raisins over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat and set aside to steep for at least 10 minutes. In a saut pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until aromatic, another minute or two. Add the kale, sherry, raisins, anchovies, orange juice and zest, and red pepper flakes. Cover the pan, turn the heat to low, and cook until the flavors are blended, about 10 minutes. Remove the cover, raise the heat to medium-high, and boil away most of the excess liquid. Remove from the heat. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Top each of the toasts with some of the greens, either warm or at room temperature, and top with shavings of Parmesan. Arrange the toasts on a platter and serve. var articleType_27_data = {}; articleType_27_data.init_step_by_step_images = 0;"

Wash it in cold water and put it in a colander to drain. After 15 to 20 minutes, pat it thoroughly dry with kitchen towels. Pit the olives, cutting the flesh away from the pits in pieces as large as possible. Set aside half the pitted olives, choosing the largest pieces; chop the other half very fine to a pulp and set aside separately. Choose a lidded saut pan that can accommodate later all the chicken pieces without overlapping. Put in the oil and the garlic and turn on the heat to medium. Saut the garlic in the uncovered pan until it becomes colored a pale gold. Add the chicken pieces and turn up the heat to high. Brown the chicken well on all sides, starting with the skin side facing the bottom of the pan to melt its fat. Sprinkle with a little salt and generous grindings of pepper. When you have browned the chicken well all over, turn down the heat to medium, remove the garlic, add the white wine and the vinegar, and cover the pan. When the liquid in the pan has evaporated by half, put in the chopped anchovies and the chopped half of the olives, turn the chicken pieces over, cover the pan, and continue cooking. Cook until the chicken is done through and through and feels very tender when pricked with a fork. Tilt the pan, pushing the chicken to one side to let the juices collect at the other end. Spoon off and discard most of the clear fat, but none of the brown cooking juices. Add the olive pieces, the parsley, and the basil and cook for 1 or 2 minutes longer, turning the chicken over once or twice. Add the lemon juice, turn the chicken pieces over, and transfer at once to a warm serving platter together with all the cooking juices in the pan. var articleType_27_data = {}; articleType_27_data.init_step_by_step_images = 0;"

With a sharp knife, slicing thinly across the grain, cut 8 equal slices, each about 1 ounce. Lightly oil two sheets of parchment or wax paper (we use the 9-inch parchment circles sold in pastry supply shops). Place 2 slices of beef side by side on one of the oiled sheets. Lay the second sheet, oiled side down, over the beef. With a heavy mallet, pound down and toward you, letting the weight of the mallet flatten the meat. Rotate the parchment and continue pounding gently. As the meat gets thinner, use lighter strokes to avoid tearing or pounding too thin. Flatten enough to form a 9-inch circle. Hold the package up to the light to make sure the meat is uniformly thin. Repeat to make the remaining 3 portions. Cover and refrigerate while preparing the garnish ingredients. To serve, remove the top sheets of paper from the pounded meat. Invert the carpaccio portions onto four chilled 9-inch plates, and carefully peel back the remaining paper sheets. Lightly season each portion with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Cut the anchovy fillets in half lengthwise and arrange 4 or 5 pieces randomly over the meat. Sprinkle with the capers and parsley. Use a vegetable peeler to shave large curls of Parmesan cheese over each serving. Finish with a good drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Serve with lemon wedges. Other garnish options: Omit the Parmesan, and sauce with strong Dijon mustard, either plain or thinned with crme frache. A little finely diced shallot, macerated briefly in lemon juice or vinegar, adds a nice spark and refreshing crunch."
